„Heneczek” font was created in 2017 as a part of a project called 
„Through the font to the book. Following in the footsteps of Teodor
Heneczek, the Piekary’s printer”, prepared by Public Library in Piekary Slaskie.
The idea to create the font was born in association with the 200th anniversary of
 the printer's birth and the 170th anniversary of his opening the first Polish printing company in Piekary.

"Heneczek" font is based on the font used in the book „Matka œwiêtych Polska, albo ¯ywoty œwiêtych,b³ogos³awionych,
wielebnych, œwi¹tobliwych, pobo¿nych Polaków i Polek…”, printed in Deutsch Piekar (now Piekary Slaskie, Poland)
in 1850 by Teodor Heneczek. The project was co-financed by the Museum of Polish History in Warsaw, within the "Patriotism of Tomorrow" program.

The author of the font is Damian Langosz.
